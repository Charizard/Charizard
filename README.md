### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm from a small town called Salem in the southern part of India :in: (Yes, India, not Oregon). After graduating college in computer science, I joined @codebrahma, a service based startup where I leared a lot of awesome stuff. Later moved to a product based startup called germ.io (currently re-branded to @zepel-io) working in the project management space where I was a full-stack developer building cool new features directly for our customers. Next, I went into a self-discovering spree along with handling a few life problems while doing some freelance work through Upwork. In mid 2019, I moved to Frankfurt :de: to work with the awesome and brilliant folks at @ClarkSource where I got prmoted to Engineering Manager.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on How to be a good dad for my beautiful baby boy, Arima :lion: :laughing:
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React Native
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Blogging, Teaching, Cooking...
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he / him
- âš¡ Fun fact: So much of my childhood time was spent watching / playing PokÃ©mon, I decided to represent myself using my favorite PokÃ©mon, @Charizard.
