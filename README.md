### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

I am Yuvaraja Balamurugan (a.k.a @Charizard)

I'm a seasoned Engineering Leader with 10+ years of experience in Software Engineering across two different countries. In my recent experience, I lead the Engineering function for 2 product lines spanning three teams with 20 people reporting directly and indirectly to me.

Currently, I am,

- ğŸ”­ working on How to be a good dad for my two lovely kids.
- ğŸŒ± skilling up my leadership abilities.
- ğŸ‘¯ looking to collaborate on Mentorship, Leadership, Running High-Performance Teams and frankly anything related to Engineering Leadership...
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: he / him
- âš¡ Fun fact: So much of my childhood time was spent watching / playing PokÃ©mon, I decided to represent myself using my favorite PokÃ©mon, @Charizard.
