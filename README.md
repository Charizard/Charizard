### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Yuvaraja Balamurugan (a.k.a @Charizard) â€” an Engineering Leader with 10+ years of experience building and scaling software teams across Europe and India.

Iâ€™ve led engineering for multiple product lines, managed global teams, and delivered platforms that generated millions in revenue. I thrive at the intersection of people, product, and technologyâ€”whether itâ€™s shaping engineering culture, driving cross-functional alignment, or mentoring future leaders.

Currently, Iâ€™m:

- ðŸ”­ Exploring what it means to be an awesome dad
- ðŸŒ± Diving deeper into Agentic AI and engineering leadership
- ðŸ‘¯ Open to collaborating on mentorship, leadership, and high-performance teams
- âš¡ Fun fact: My GitHub handle is inspired by my favorite PokÃ©monâ€”Charizard. Because letâ€™s face it: leadership should be bold, fiery, and a little bit fun.

Letâ€™s build, learn, and grow together.
